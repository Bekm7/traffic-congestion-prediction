# NYC Traffic Congestion Prediction üöñ

This project explores NYC Yellow Taxi trip data and weather conditions to predict average vehicle speed during trips ‚Äî used here as a proxy for traffic congestion. While the scale of Manhattan traffic is massive, this project was primarily a personal learning exercise aimed at sharpening my skills in:

>Data cleaning and preprocessing

>Feature engineering (temporal, spatial, weather)

>Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

>Regression modeling and performance tuning

The final model uses XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning to predict average speed (mph) from various features such as pickup/dropoff location, time of day, weather conditions, and trip characteristics.

This project was developed independently, from data preprocessing to modeling and evaluation, using a sample dataset (50,000 rows from January 2025). Though not meant for large-scale deployment, it demonstrates my ability to handle real-world data and build explainable models end-to-end.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Predicts average traffic speed from time, zone, and weather
- Uses XGBoost regression model
- Feature engineering: rush hour, zone frequency, weather handling
- Jupyter Notebook based workflow

## üöÄ How to Run

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

##Model Info
Trained on 46904 samples of Jan 2025 taxi + hourly weather data

Model Performance Comparison
Model	        RMSE  R¬≤ Score

Linear Reg	4.630	0.369

Random Forest	3.843	0.565

XGBoost	        3.686	0.600

XGBoost (Tuned)	3.567	0.625

>The final model used is XGBoost with hyperparameter tuning, which achieved the best performance in terms of both RMSE and R¬≤.

Based on the performance XGBoost was selected for final prediction
